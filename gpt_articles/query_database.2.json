In VMWare Ware, a hypervisor is used to create virtual machines (VMs) which can be used for testing, development, or running multiple production environments on a single server. The hypervisor sits between the hardware and the VMs, allocating and managing resources such as CPU, memory, and storage. There are two types of hypervisors: Type 1, which runs directly on the host machine's hardware, and Type 2, which runs on top of a host operating system. VMWare's ESXi is an example of a Type 1 hypervisor.", "what is vmware\n": "Title: What is VM Ware and how is it used?\n\nQuestion: I keep hearing about VM Ware but I'm not sure what it is or how it's used.
